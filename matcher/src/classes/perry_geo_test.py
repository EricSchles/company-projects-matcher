		A format for describing the state of the system:
		------------------------------------------------
		'students' is a list of Students (created from the given input file).

		'unmatched_students' is a list of Students who are not currently matched
		to a project.

		'state' is a tuple of (Project list, Student list) where:
			- Project list:
				- Each project is assigned some number of students
				(can be changed in classes/Project.)
				- At any given point, 'state' tells us what the current state of
				  the system is (i.e. which Students are with which Projects.)
			- Student list:
				- These are the unmatched students (students who are not on any
					proje ct). 

		Desired postconditions:
			- Each student is matched to exactly one project.
			- Each project has its desired number and makeup of students:
				Ex. 2 MBA, 2 MEng

		The function to be minimized is the energy of the state (energy(state)).
		In our case, energy calculates the cost of assigning people to projects.
