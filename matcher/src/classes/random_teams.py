def create_teams_on_all_fields(first_students, first_name, second_students, second_name, team_size):
	'''
		A loop that goes through the sample space of students
		and creates teams of students.

		The set of teams teams adhere to our requirements:
			- Plausibility: teams will be formed from selection without 
			replacement (each student is assigned to exactly one team.)
			- Size: Each team will be of a size found in team_sizes (or +- 1).
			- Diversity: each team will have one student of each input type.

		Parameters
		----------

		first_ids: a list of the student IDs of the first group of students
				   (i.e. MBAs).

		second_ids: a list of the student IDs of the second group of students
					(i.e. MEngs).

		team_size: the target size for teams. If there are extra students left
					at the end, we will add them to teams.
					This process will create 
						((total_num_students) mod team_size)
					teams with (team_size + 1) students.

		Returns
		--------
		A tuple (teams, l1, l2), with:

			teams: a list of lists that represents the current teams. Each team list will
			contain (type * id) tuples. These teams will also contain None.

			l1: the remaining members of the first group passed into create_teams_type_id.

			l2: the remaining members of the second group passed into create_teams_type_id.
