				# Sort the students by the highest rank first
			# If this project now forms a full team (length of students = team_size)

				# Cost = 10000000

	# Sort the projects by lowest cost first.
		# If the cost is < 10000000:
			# This means the team is full.

	# For each of the projects
		# If the project is 
	# Add (cost, project) tuple to the projects with costs list. 

	# Sort the projects by their costs level (lowest first).
		# If there is a project whose goodness is not 0:
			# This means that the project has a full team.
			# Add this project to the finished_projects list
			# Remove the students from any other projects.
			# Remove the students from any other waiting lists.

	# TODO: think about goodness of a team of 1. I think this is already implemented, but
	# make sure that the diversity of a singleton team is 0 so that the algorithm will not
	# choose these options.

	# NEW APPROACH
	# Remove the projects that are full.
	# For each of the remaining projects:
		# Add the students that are waiting until there is a full team
			# Sort the students by the highest rank first
	
	# Sort the projects by number of spots remaining (lowest first).
	# Should have some sort of check: will only allow teams of 3 (less than that is weird)

	# If the team size is 3 (or some allowable number):
			# For all students
				# Remove the student from other waiting lists
				# The student should not be on other teams' student lists

	# For all of the remaining projects that are not size 3:
		# Add students to a sadness list
