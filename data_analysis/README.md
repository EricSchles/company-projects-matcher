Data Analysis
=====

[data](https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/tree/master/data_analysis/data): I sent out a survey to friends and faculty (included [here](https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/blob/master/data_analysis/data/info/link_to_survey.txt)), which asked questions about a variety of factors that I thought would differentiate students. Various versions of the responses to this survey are included in this folder.

[results](https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/tree/master/data_analysis/results): This contains some results from runs of the data analysis files included in src. Results are displayed in text files.

[src](https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/tree/master/data_analysis/src): Contains the code for analyses I performed.

Numerical
---------
[Clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis): performed clustering to see there were groups of datapoints that were very similar.

[Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance): calculates the Mahalanobis distance between the students' feature vectors.

[Regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis): performs [Ordinary Least Squares Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) to calculate the relationships between variables.


Visualization
--------------
[Histogram](): creates histograms of the data (plots numerical data and color codes by the categorical data).

[Scatterplot](): creates scatterplots of data. Plots pairs of data against each other, to view how the individual variables correlate with one another.
