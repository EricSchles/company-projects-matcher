Ordered logistic regression (ordinal logit): a regression model for ordinal dependent variables.
	- Extension of the logistic regression model that applies to dichotomous dependent variables, allowing for more than two ordered response categories.
	- ***Use for coding_ability, num_yrs_work_experience, group_experience, and m_group_experience.
	- These coefficients cannot be consistently estimated using OLS.
			- Usually estimated using maximum likelihood.
					- Maximum likelihood estimates are computed by using iteratively reweighted lease squares.

Multinomial logistic regression: predicts the probabilities of a categorically distributed dependent variable, given a set of independent variables (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.).
	- ***Use for ug_major and degree_pursuing.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA): 
	- Continuous independent variable and a categorical dependent variable
	- Assume that the independent variables are normally distributed
