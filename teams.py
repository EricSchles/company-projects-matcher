def create_teams(MBA_student_ids, MEng_student_ids, team_size):
	'''
		A loop that goes through the sample space of students
		and creates teams of students.

		The set of teams teams adhere to our requirements:
			- Plausibility: teams will be formed from selection without 
			replacement (each student is assigned to exactly one team.)
			- Size: Each team will be of a size found in team_sizes.
			- Diversity: each team will have one student of each input type.

		Parameters
		----------

		MBA_student_ids: a list of the student ids of the MBA students.

		MEng_student_ids: a list of the student ids of the MBA students.

		team_size: the target size for teams. If there are extra students left
					at the end, add them to teams:
					This process will create 
						((total_num_students) mod team_size)
					teams with (team_size + 1) students.

					TODO: add to teams based on their technical/businessy needs.

		Returns
		--------
		A tuple (teams, l1, l2, team_size), with:

			teams: a list of lists that represent teams. Each team list will contain 
			(type * id) tuples.

			l1: the first team passed into create_teams.

			l2: the second team passed into create_teams.

			team_size: passed along from input.
