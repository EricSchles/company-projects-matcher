========================

The matching algorithm for [Company Projects: CS 5999] (http://tech.cornell.edu/experience/company-projects/).

[data analysis:] (https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/tree/master/data_analysis) Contains the initial survey sent out to faculty and friends, and contains code and results of data analysis on the survey responses. 

[matcher] (https://github.com/cornelltech/company-projects-matcher/tree/master/matcher): Contains test data, classes, and code for performing the match. The matcher performs [simulated annealing] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), and uses [perrygeo](https://github.com/perrygeo)'s [implementation](https://github.com/perrygeo/python-simulated-annealing).
